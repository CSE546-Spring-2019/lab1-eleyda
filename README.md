Just hit make, it will take care of compiling when on stdlinux

The program first opens all of the files, then checks the size of the files
After that is when the program starts looking for the strings
This is not the most effiecent way to do it, but it works on linux

This also works for windows with the cygwin bash shell when run on windows
